# Projet-PoC

//Technical steps

A project can be done by doing several step during the period of the project. These steps can be summarize into six distinct steps as follow :

step 1: Define the objectives for the project
step 2:  Divide the project and define several tasks
step 3: define the tasks and how they follow each other
step 4: Add time constraints and deadlines
step 5: Define and attribute the different ressources available
step 6: Plan the project and follow the project since its beginning to its end


First we make several brainstorming to find proof of concept and ideas. Then we look their feasibility and their complexity. Finally we choose to implement our smart automatic home system controlled according to the climatic conditions (temperature, humidity, daylight)

Then we divide the work into tasks, me and Eug√©nie were in charge of the implementation, Antonin was in charge of the block diagramm and of the whole design of our system, Corentin was in charge of the communication and the report. But each could participate to the tasks of the others so each could bring is idea and contribute in the project.

We planned a little schedule with deadlines in order to have a follow-up of the project and to see what tasks were already done and which are left to be done. 

We have at our disposal many ressources we could use : our knowledge on the arduino, our knowledge of programmation and also all the corresponding software to use.
